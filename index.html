    <div style="font-size: 15px;" class="desc">Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.</div>

    <div style="font-size: 15px;" class="desc">Clint Barton, under house-arrest, is teaching his daughter archery during a family picnic. Suddenly, she and the rest of his family are turned to ash as a result of the Snap from the last film. Meanwhile, Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space on the Benatar, orbiting Titan, after their defeat by Thanos, with life support running low. Captain Marvel rescues them, and brings the ship to the New Avengers Facility, where the surviving Avengers from the battle of Wakanda are residing. They greet Tony, and the team laments on what was lost, before formulating a plan to steal the Infinity Stones back from Thanos and use them to reverse his actions. Despite Rhodey's pleas for Tony to sit back down in his wheelchair, Tony goes up against Steve and foolishly blames him for Thanos' snap even though it wasn't his fault before angrily taking his heart out of his chest, giving it to Steve, and collapses on the floor in the process.</div>
